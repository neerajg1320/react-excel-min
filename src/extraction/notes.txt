// Relation between Signature and Schema has to be understood.
// Something which is required in a schema has to be provided at the end of processing.
// Something which is not required might be mandatory in a signature.
// Signature is used for detection.
// Schema is the final shape the date is in.

We have defined a schema for bankStatement. The signature for a bank have to be compliant with the Schema. That means the signatures should lead to schema even if they are not exactly as a schema. For example the schema has a room for transactionDate but it might not be there in a signature as the bank statement might not support it.
